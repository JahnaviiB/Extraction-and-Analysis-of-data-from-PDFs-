Overview
* The need to manage and analyze PDF files effectively and rapidly has grown critical, given the Internet's explosive growth in the number of PDF files. This text extraction
* and analysis from PDFs’ enhances productivity and accuracy to facilitate knowledge discovery and data-driven decision making.In this research work,afresh approach to extract
* and analyze text from PDFs’ is presented.

Motivation

* Cambridge Analytica
* Hindenburg Case

Objective

* In this paper, a new approach to extract and analyse information from PDF documents is presented
* Text conversion from PDFs makes the content searchable, which facilitates finding specific information more easily
* Entity extraction is one of the key steps in enhancing the overall performance
* The secondary objective would be to extract insights with the application of sentiment analysis and TF-IDF to both combined and entity-specific PDF documents

Analysis

* Sentiment Analysis
* Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)

Concusion

* The use of TF-IDF simultaneously revealed important terms and their significance in the papers
* By identifying important terms, we were able to identify important entities and themes and obtain a quantitative assessment of their significance to the texts and the larger corpus

Future Work
* Build a well structured application including the components explained in this paper and additionally introducing the feedback mechanism on the accuracy of the system’s extraction and analysis to continually improve the system.
